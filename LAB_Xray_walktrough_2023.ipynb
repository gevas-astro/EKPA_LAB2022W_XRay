    "The standard $Z^2$ search calculates the phase of each photon and calculates the sinusoidal functions above for each photon. This is very computationally expensive if the number of photons is high. Therefore, in Stingray, the search is performed by binning the pulse profile first and using the phases of the folded profile in the formula above, multiplying the squared sinusoids of the phases of the pulse profile by a weight corresponding to the number of photons at each phase.\n",

    "Since the sinusoids are only executed on a small number of bins, while the epoch folding procedure just consists of a very fast histogram-like operation, the speedup of this new formula is obvious. Care must be put into the choice of the number of bins, in order to maintain a good approximation even when the number of harmonics is high. As a rule of thumb, use _a number of bins at least 10 times larger than the number of harmonics_."
